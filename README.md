# RePPo

# Pair programming:
    •	It is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation (with single machine). 
    •	One will be the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator , reviews each line of code as it is typed in code editor.
    •	The two programmers switch their roles frequently.
    •	No of programmers need not to restrict 2 only.

But many times, it might not possible for programmers to be at one place.
RePPo is the solution for this.
We are developing web application for remote pair programming(RePPo).
This will share code between coders who want to develop through pair programming , runs those programs and shows output there.


# Technologies:
•	React
•	Node js
•	Express


# Design:
This app initially asks for username and room Id.
Here in this app users can create their room for programming with others so that their coding editor can be visible to other members in the room.
 
If the user has no room Id, new room Id can be genereated by clicking on new room.
After entering user name, by clicking on join button or clicking “Enter” button user enters into new room.
 
There other programmers names who are in the same room will be visible to user.
Major part of screen will be code editor on which programmers write their code.
A drop down menu for selecting programming languages.
We are providing Python , C,  C++, Java.
A drop down for changing the theme of editor.
One window for to see the output of  programs.
One window for giving the input to the code.
The code entered in the editor will be visible to all others in room.
They also can change the code.
Also There will a chat box for communication of codes in a room.
